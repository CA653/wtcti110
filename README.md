# About Me
## My Interests, well, a few
* I'm really into music, perhaps most but not all kinds. The list of generes I like is longer than the list of those I don't. I also enjoy dancing to and playing music
## Recommended Websites
* [Pandora](https://www.Pandora.com)
	* This is my go to site for streaming music. I know a lot of people are more into Spotify, but I guess I started on Pandora so early that its still my preferred music [streaming service][Pandora]. 
* [Music Map](https://www.musicmap.info)
	* This site features a really visualization of the roots of various generes of music. It starts off with a broadview, but once you start to zoom in it begins to reveal the connections between various generes. I think it's rather interesting how some genres unexpectedly connect and that by clicking a genre title you can learn more about that particular genere of music.
